# Heart Disease Prediction
Heart Diseases are the leading cause of death in the world, they can be caused by different kind of factors such as genetics, lifestyle, medical conditions, environmental factors etc. Early diagnosis is crucial for carrying out a successful treatment, therefore we decided to perform an analysis to understand which are the most influential biometrics that define the condition, focusing on a binary classification task which uses parameters that can be obtained simply by performing clinical tests. The dataset we are going to analyze and use for our task was created by combining different datasets, already available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, over common features. This dataset contains 918 patient records described by 11 variables plus a binary target for the diagnosis. Out of all the patients, 508 have a positive diagnosis.

##Project Outline
1. *Data Preprocessing:* Dealing with categorical variables and NA values
2. *Data Exploration:* Performing EDA consiting of univariate, bivariate, and correlation anlaysis
3. *Data Modeling:* Testing different statisical models on the data, such as: Logistic, Ridge, Lasso regression, LDA, and QDA
4. *Data Interpretation:* Explaining the best model and making further considerations on the behavior of a specific variable
5. *Conclusions:* Discussing the results and suggesting potential applications
